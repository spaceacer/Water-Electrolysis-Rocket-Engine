# Water-Electrolysis-Rocket-Engine

This repository documents the development and architecture of a water electrolysis-based propulsion system designed for small-scale space applications, such as CubeSats or educational testbeds.

## üìò Overview

The system leverages the electrolysis of water to generate hydrogen and oxygen gases, which are then stored and used as a bipropellant for controlled thrust generation. This approach enables a safe, low-cost, and refillable propulsion mechanism ideal for microspacecraft station-keeping, orbital adjustment, or academic research.

Key highlights include:
- On-demand generation of H‚ÇÇ and O‚ÇÇ using a custom made electrolysis (made using stainless steel mesh)
- Pulse combustion engine for efficient, small-scale thrust
- Arduino/ESP32 microcontroller-based ignition and valve control
- Modular architecture for static testing and microspaceflight simulation
